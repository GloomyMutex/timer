Properties of SVG Circle
########################
* r: Radius
* cx: The vertical access (going right)
* cy: The horizontal access (going down)
* fill: Content inside the circle (inside color - can also make transparent) 
* stroke: The border around the outside of the circle (starts on right side and goes around clockwise)
* stroke-width: Size of the border outside of the circle
* stroke-dasharray: Can take two values separated by a space 
    - one for dash size and the other for gap size around perimeter
    - if only one value is used then that will be the size of both
* stroke-dashoffset: Gives extra spacing ontop of the dasharray's gap 
    - positive values for counter-clockwise
    - negative values for clockwise
* transform: has a rotate function that takes 3 values
    - first value is the amount you want to rotate in degrees
    - second two values are for the origin point of the transform
    - normally transforms are done from the top left corner
    - the values of 200 200 tell it to rotate around the center point of the circle (only for this size circle)
